The AND Advantage: Unlocking the Compounding Value of Brand + Performance Advertising

Key Themes:
- Performance-only strategies are plateauing
- Brand equity reduces acquisition cost and increases pricing power
- The customer journey is non-linear and emotional
- Every channel can support both brand and performance
- Holistic measurement is critical for real ROI
- Strategic question is no longer “brand or performance,” but “how much of each?”

Action Frameworks:
1. Embrace the messy middle
2. Stop assigning fixed roles to channels
3. Adopt full-funnel team structures
4. Evolve attribution and measurement systems
5. Use Compass tool to weigh 10 key allocation factors

Category Benchmarks (examples):
- Auto: 70/30 brand to performance
- QSR: 55/45
- CPG: 75/25
- Theatrical: 80/20 performance-heavy
- DTC Early Stage: 30/70
- Streaming: varies by churn/acquisition

Use of Horizon Compass:
- Start with category baseline
- Weigh factors: maturity, trust, decision type, regulation, seasonality
- Adjust sliders
- Calculate tailored allocation

Performance marketing has become default due to ease of measurement and CFO appeal—but long-term brand erosion and saturation are now risks. Brands that rebalance are seeing increased ROI and conversion efficiency.

Case studies include Booking.com, Expedia, Peloton, and Northeast Healthcare Provider.

Bottom Line:
Brands that balance well achieve +30% marketing efficiency, +10% topline growth—with no increase in budget.
